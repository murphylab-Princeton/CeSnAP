CeSnAP (C. elegans Snapshot Analysis Platform)

We have created a ML-based algorithm, CeSnAP, paired with a rapid snapshot acquisition technique
that serves as a simple and versatile workflow to quantify C. elegans behavioral phenotypes [1].
CeSnAP can be used for smart analysis of videos or snapshots upon training of a convolutional
neural network (C-NN). The program maintains low data overhead, eliminates the need for user
supervision, and can be utilized by investigators with no computational background, greatly
accelerating efforts to perform high-throughput screens. 

Using CeSnAP, we performed high-throughput curling analysis of a total of 17,000 worms in order
to identify drugs that ameliorate PD-like motor dysfunction in C. elegans. Our high-throughput
automated curling assay can record, process, and analyze experimental data 40 times faster than
the manual thrashing assay, and has allowed for high-throughput drug screening [1] and testing
of disease mechanisms [2, 3]. The demo examples are available on 
https://murphylab.princeton.edu/CeSnAP/.

CeSnAP uses Bio-Formats MATLAB scripts for reading *.nd2 files. User can download Bio-Formats 
from following link: https://docs.openmicroscopy.org/bio-formats/5.3.4/users/matlab/index.html.
please add "bioformats_package.jar" to bfmatlab folder for reading .*ND2 files.
